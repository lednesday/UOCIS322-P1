# UOCIS322 - Project 1 #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, introduction to software engineering,
at the University of Oregon.

## Overview

### What is this repository for? ###

The objectives of this mini-project are:

  * Experience the git workflow with separate configuration:
  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;
  turn in configuration file with reference to repo.
  (Project 0 is practice for this part.)
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of
  basic web architecture
  * Use automated tests to check progress (plus manual tests for good measure)

### What do I need?  Where will it work? ###

* Use the server to test, edit wherever you'd like.

* The server currently has all the requirements (if you don't know your
credentials, contact me.)

* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged),
therefore using a port number above 1000.

## Tasks

* Fork this repository to create your own repository on GitHub,
and make sure it is *PUBLIC*. Be sure to add me as collaborator so I have access.
(Read the documentation as needed, and create an account on GitHub
  if you don't have one.
  You should've already done finished this as part of Project 0.)
* Clone your repository onto the machine you want to work on.
* Add the following functionality in `pageserver.py`.
(a) If URL ends with `name.html` or `name.css`
(i.e., if `path/to/name.html` is in document path (from `DOCROOT`)),
send content of `name.html` or `name.css` with proper http response.
(b) If `name.html` is not in current directory Respond with 404 (not found).
(c) If a page starts with or includes one of the symbols(`~` `//` `..`), and that includes the initial forward slash that all requests have,
respond with 403 forbidden error. For example, `url=hostname:5000/..name.html`
or `/~name.html` would give 403 forbidden error.
* Make and test your changes. Use both automated tests
(the script in the `tests` directory) and some manual tests.
* Revise this `README.md` file: Erase what is no longer relevant and add
identifying information.
If you have concerns about adding your email ID, let me know.

  ```

* Copy the `credentials-skel.ini` file to `credentials.ini`,
then edit it to contain correct information including your
GitHub repository URL. `credentials.ini` should NOT be under version control
(exclude it using your `.gitignore` file)
* Commit and push ALL your changes to GitHub
(except those not under revision control)
* Test deployment in other environments.
Deployment should work "out of the box" with this command sequence:

  ```
  git clone <yourGitRepository> <targetDirectory>
  ```

  ```
  cd <targetDirectory>
  ```

  ```
  make run
  ```
  or
  ```
  make start
  ```

  *test it with a browser now; send a request*

  ```
  make stop
  ```

* Alternatively, use the script under `tests` folder to test the
expected outcomes in an automated fashion.
It is accompanied by README file and comments (inside tests.sh)
explaining how to test your code.
* Check and revise your `credentials.ini` file.
The autograder will read this. Be precise.
The autograder IS NOT very good at guessing what you meant to write.
* Turn in the `credentials.ini` file in Canvas.
Autograder will use this file to access your GitHub repository.   

## Grading Rubric

* Your code works as expected: 100 points

* For every wrong functionality (i.e., (a), (b), and (c) above),
20 points will be docked off.

* If none of the functionalities work, 40 points will be given.
Assuming the credentials.ini is submitted with the correct URL of your repo.

* If `credentials.ini` is not submitted or the repo is not found, 0 will be assigned.
